		<p>An IBIS database username and password is required to log in. Once logged in, the user will be directed to the Home page. Any previously saved queries on that particular user's account should appear automatically on the screen.</p>

		<p>You can search through previously saved queries by typing in keywords in the search box on the top right of the saved query table. The name of the saved query along with its associated field names and filters can be viewed in this table.  Click "Load" under Actions to load the selected fields and filters that were chosen when the query was initially created. The selected fields and filters will automatically be listed under the "Define Fields" and "Define Filters" tabs, respectively. A saved query can be deleted by clicking "Delete" from the Actions column on the Home page.</p>
