		<p>The Data Querying Tool (DQT) enables users to query and download combined demographic, diagnostic, behavioral, imaging and quality control data.</p>

		<p>The Home tab displays login information about the user, the time of last data cache update, followed by a table listing all queries which the user has previously stored in the database. The number of saved queries displayed per page can be modified in the top left corner of the Saved Queries table. Any results exceeding this display limit will be displayed on subsequent pages within the table, accessible via buttons labelled First, Previous, Next and Last, visible in the lower right corner after scrolling to the bottom of the table.</p>

		<p>The query name, selected fields and filters for each saved query are displayed in the table.  Clicking on any column header (e.g. "Name") will sort the list by that column. Queries can also be filtered by keyword (e.g. 'Age' fields) via the search box at the top right corner of the Saved Queries table.</p>

		<p>To reload a saved query, click "Load" under the Actions column to retrieve and load the query fields and filters that were selected when the query was initially created.  These will be displayed under the "Define Fields" and "Define Filters" tabs, respectively.</p>

		<p>A saved query can be removed by clicking "Delete" from the Actions column.</p>
