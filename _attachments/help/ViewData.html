		<H3>Help: View Data</H3>
		<p>The View Data tab executes queries, displays query results, and enables download of data.</p>
		<p>Under "Actions", click the "Run Query" button to execute the query on the database.</p>
		<p>Under the "Data" section, query results will be displayed in a table with each row representing a candidate at a particular visit, and each column representing a field that was selected for the query.  Any data results that were excluded by the query filters will not appear in this table.
		</br>
		Results can be viewed either longitudinally or cross-sectionally, i.e. one row per candidate, or one row per candidateâ€™s visit, via the dropdown menu directly under the "Data" section title.
		</br>
		Results can be also sorted by field by clicking on the table's column headers. The number of results displayed per page can be modified, and keywords can be entered in the Search box.</p>
		<p>After running a query and viewing the results, click the "Download Table Data as CSV" button under "Actions" to save the query output dataset to your computer as a comma-separated value file.
		</br>
		If any Imaging files are included in the query output, click "Download All Files as ZIP" to save compressed packages of the files and data to your computer.
		</br>
		The query can also be saved for reuse, to avoid constructing the query from scratch in future. Click the "Save Query" button, and a pop-up dialog will appear, asking whether the fields and/or filters should be saved. Click all checkboxes that apply, enter a name for the query, then click "Save query" to complete the process.</p>
		<p>This saved query should now appear under the "<a href="Home.html">Home</a>" tab. New fields can be selected and saved under the same name to directly update the current query. See the section on "Saved Queries" for further information on actions that can be performed on these previously created queries.</p>
