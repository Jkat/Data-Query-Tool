		<H3>Help: Define Fields</H3>
		<p>To create a new query, the user can proceed through the tabs found at the top of the page, starting with "Define Fields". All of the fields are grouped by instrument. These instruments are listed alphabetically in the drop-down menu beside the label "Choose category". Once a category has been selected, all field names and their accompanying descriptions will be listed in a table. The last column specifies whether the field contains a downloadable file. For instruments that have a large number of fields, the entries will be listed on multiple pages. The number of entries that appear per page can be selected through the drop-down directly under "Choose category". Users can navigate through the pages to find the field of interest by scrolling to the bottom field table, then clicking on the "Previous" and "Next" links at the bottom right corner.</p>

		<p>In addition, users can sort the list of fields by clicking on a column of interest (e.g. "Field", "Description", or "Downloadable File"). To search by keyword, a search function is available at the top right of the screen. Note that the Search function will only return fields within the chosen instrument, and not across all categories.</p>

		<p>Select a field to include in the query by clicking in the row for that field. This will highlight the entire row and will add the field to the "Selected Fields" table in the bottom half of the screen. The user can remove a field by either clicking again on the highlighted field row, or by clicking "Remove" under the Actions column in the "Selected Fields" table.</p>
 
		<p>If all fields from a particular instrument are desired, click "Add all" next to the "Choose category" dropdown to select all fields from that instrument. Similarly, click "Remove all" to de-select all fields from that particular instrument.</p>
 
		<p>Note that demographic candidate information is included in the  "demographics" category. Please choose that category from the "Choose category" dropdown to view all possible demographic fields.</p>
