		<p>Once all fields and filters have been selected, please proceed to the "View Data" tab and click "Run Query". The results will appear in a table, with each row representing a candidate at a particular visit, and each column representing a field that was selected for the query. If there is data for the same candidate from different visits, the user has the option of viewing and downloading all data for that candidate longitudinally by selecting "longitudinal" from the dropdown next to "How to arrange data". Otherwise, the data will by default appear cross-sectionally. The user will need to click "Run Query" again to view the data longitudinally.</p>
		
		<p>The user can also control how many entries they would like to see displayed in the table of output data.</p>

		<p>The data can be downloaded in csv file format by clicking "Download Data as CSV". If fields were included that have downloadable files, the user can use the button "Download all Files as ZIP".</p>
		
		<p>The current query can be saved in order to re-run the same query in future. Upon clicking "Save Query", a pop-up window will appear asking whether the fields and/or filters should be saved. Click the checkboxes that apply, enter a name for the query, then click "Save query". This query should now appear under the "Home" tab. New fields can be selected and saved under the same name to directly update the current query. See the section on "Saved Queries" for further information on actions that can be performed on these previously created queries.</p>
