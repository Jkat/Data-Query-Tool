		<H3>Help: Define Filters</H3>
		<p>Filters can be applied on any field in order to limit the set of results returned by a query, e.g. to extract data collected only at one specific site, or from a particular visit.</p> 
		<p>The "Define Filters" tab is organized like "<a href="DefineFields.html">Define Fields</a>", where data fields are grouped per instrument or category. Select a category, then click on a field of interest to add it to the list of Selected Filters at bottom.
		</br>
		Finally, in the Selected Filters panel, define the filter criteria on that field via the "Operator"  and "Value" columns. More than one filter may be added to a query.  Multiple filters will be applied using 'and' logic.
		</br>
 		The operators are as follows:
			<ul>
        		<li>= equal to</li>
        		<li>!= does not equal</li>
        		<li><= less than</li>
        		<li>>= greater than</li>
        		<li>startsWith: filter for values starting with a specific character or string</li>
        		<li>contains: filter for values containing a specific character or string</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
		<p>Alternatively, a specific set of candidates or candidate visits can be defined as a filter by uploading a CSV file containing a list of candidate IDs with optional visit label (via the "Choose File" button).</p>
		<p>Example: to query data collected at visit V01, select "demographics" from the Choose Category dropdown, then scroll down and click on "demographics,Visit_label".  This field should now be displayed in the Selected Filters panel below. Next, define the filter constraint under the "Operator" and "Values" columns, e.g. select "=" and enter "V01".</p>
		<p>Once filters have been defined, continue to the "<a href="ViewData.html">View Data</a>" tab.</p>
		<H4>Notes on querying behavioral data in LORIS</H4>
		<p>To extract only fully administered and fully complete instrument datasets, include the following field filters for each instrument in your query:
			<ul>
        		<li>Administration = "All"  or "Partial" (Note that "Partial" Administration poses a potential caveat for analysis)</li>
        		<li>Data_entry = "Complete"</li>
        		<li>DDE_complete = "Y"  (for instruments where Double Data Entry applies)</li>
        		<li>Conflicts_Exist = "N"  (all data entry quality issues have been resolved)</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, under 'demographics' category: 
			<ul>
        		<li>Current_stage = "Visit"</li>
        		<li>Failure = "Neither" (to exclude both Failed and Withdrawn candidates)</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
